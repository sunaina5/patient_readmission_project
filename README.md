# patient_readmission_project

Unplanned hospital readmissions cost healthcare systems billions annually and are a key metric of patient care quality. This project implements a production-grade MLOps pipeline to predict the 30-day readmission risk of patients. By identifying high-risk individuals before discharge, clinicians can provide targeted interventions to improve outcomes and reduce hospital penalties.
